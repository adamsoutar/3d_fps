# Texture Licenses

These textures were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/creative-commons-images/),
who say that attribution is 'Not required but appreciated'.

I have in some cases made alterations like resizing or changing
their format from JPG to PNG, but they aren't mine, and the
original images are from photographers on that site.
